# 1. Hello

Hello Diary,

It's me - Eva Wingdale! Did you miss me? I bet you did!

I love: Drawing, Patterns, Daydreaming, The word plum, Funky hats, Questionnaires, My friends, Being super excited!

I DO NOT love: My brother Humphrey's horrible singing, Sue Clawson ("Meany McMeanerson"), The color grey, Washing my feathers, Being scared, Squirrels, Mom's caterpillar sandwiches, Feeling longly.

Here is my family: Dad, Mom, Baby Mo, Humphrey, Me.

And here is my pet bat, Baxter!

He's so cuddly!

By the way, I'm an owl! And owls are awesome.

We can fly.

We sleep in the daytime.

We're awake in the nighttime!

And we live in trees.

I live at Treehouse 11 on Woodpine Avenue in Treetopolis.

My BEST friend is Lucy Beakman. She lives in the tree next door.

We have sleepovers all the time! Out next one is on Sunday - one week from today! Yay!

Lucy has a pet lizard named Rex. Rex is Baxter's best friend, too!

Lucy and I go to Treetop Owlementary. Here is a photo of our class: Miss Featherbottom, Zac, Macy, Lilly, Carlos, Sue, Jacob, Lucy, Me, George, Zara.

I'm off to sleep now. Talk to you tomorrow, Diary!
