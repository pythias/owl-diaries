# 2. Bored, Bored, BORED!

When I got home from school today, I did the same things I always do.

I took Baxter for a fly.

I ate a snack.

I did my WINGLISH homework.

I did arts and crafts.

I made this cool bead bracelet!

I tried on new outfits.

I had a fight with Humphrey. He left his stinky socks in my bedroom AGAIN! He is such a squirrel-head!

But after all that, I still had HOURS to go before sunrise. I had nothing to do!

I called Lucy.

"Lucy! I am SO bored! Can you come over?"

"Sorry! I can't. Tomorrow is the first day of spring, so my mom and I are planting flowers."

"Flowers? Spring?! Lucy, you are a genius!"

"Huh? I am? Okay, then!"

"Gotta go!"

"Bye, Eva!"

Thank goodness for Lucy! She just gave me the most FLAPPY-FABULOUS idea!! I need to brainstorm! I'll be back!

Okay, Diary. I've been thinking and thinking. Now I have the BEST plan ever! But there is no time to tell you. I'm off to bed. I cannot wait to tell Lucy (and YOU) all about it tomorrow!
