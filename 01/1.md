# 1. Meet Eva

Hello Diary

My name is Eva Wingdale. I live at Treehouse 11 on Woodpine Avenue in Treetopolis.

I love: YOU - my new diary! Drawing, Colors (especially red), Making stuff, The word pumpkin, Cool clothes, School, Being busy.

I DO NOT love: My brother Humphrey's stinky socks, Sue Clawson (She is REALLY mean!), Cleaning my beak, The word plop, Asking for help, Squirrels, Mom's slug sandwiches, Being bored.

Oh, and I'm an owl!

Owls are super cool.

We're awake in the nighttime.

We're asleep in the daytime.

We can turn our heads almost all the way around.

And we can fly!

Here is my owl family: Dad, Me, Humphrey, Baby Mo, Mom, the Wingdales.

AND here is my pet bat, Baxter!

He's so cute!

My very BEST friend in the whole OWLIVERSE is Lucy Beakman.

Lucy lives in the tree next door to mine. We have sleepovers all the time!

Lucy also sits next to me at school. Here is a photo of out class: Miss Featherbottom, Macy, Zac, Carlos, Jacob, George, Lilly, Lucy, Me, Zara, Sue.

Oh, no! I'm late for school! I'll write again tomorrow, Diary.
